**Solution Design 30%**

**100%** - Full consideration has been given to design alternatives and an entirely appropriate and effective solution results. Very effective creativity in designing a solution to the problem that is as close to an optimum solution as can be expected
**75%**  - Designs fully reflect good principles. Selection and application of principles is very effective, showing insight and creativity.
**50%**  - Effective design. Appreciation of principles and has applied these. Evidence of consideration of alternatives and judgement in decisions.
**25%**  - Weaknesses in design, but shows some awareness of appropriate principles and can apply these reasonably well with fair (if sometimes basic) justification.
**0%**   - Little evidence of appropriate design. Design decisions not justified

**Preprocessing (inc. selecting features) 30%**
**100%** - Strong justifications. Full consideration has been given to each of steps and real depth of insight of each step and creativity is shown.
**75%**  - Very good justification for selection. Selection and application of techniques is very effective, showing insight and creativity.
**50%**  - Good justifications. Appreciation of principles. Evidence of consideration of alternatives and judgement in decision.
**25%**  - Some weaknesses in the process and can apply these reasonably well with fair justification.
**0%**   - Little or no attempt to apply appropriate techniques

**Selecting and refining ML algorithms 20%**
**100%** - Strong justifications. Full consideration has been given to each of steps and real depth of insight of each step and creativity is shown.
**75%**  - Very good selection of algorithms and procedures - competently applied. Very good understanding of theories. Justification for selection is sound. Very good selection strategies.
**50%**  - Good judgement in selection and application of algorithm and procedures. Good understanding of theories.
**25%**  - Reasonable selection and application of algorithm and procedures.
**0%**   - Appropriate analysis or judgement severely lacking or not provided.

**Evaluating model 10%**
**100%** - Strong justification on evaluation methods. Selected models are fairly evaluated. All chosen evaluation measures correct and complete.
**75%**  - Good justification on evaluation methods. All chosen evaluation measures are correct and complete.
**50%**  - Selected evaluation methods are appropriate to the objectives. Good justification for selection.
**25%**  - Reasonable justification for selection showing some awareness of appropriate principles.
**0%**   - An insufficient awareness of principles with very weak or no justification.

**Report 10%**
**100%** - Organisation of work is of a very high standard, likely to be highly stimulating, and at the limits of what may be expected at postgraduate level.
**75%**  - Documentation is very well ordered, concise and coherent. Excellent use of diagrams, tables and spaces.
**50%**  - Organisation of work is likely to show few mistakes/limitations. Very good use of diagrams, tables and spaces.
**25%**  - There is an overall structure evident but does not offer strong flow and progression. Good use of diagrams, tables and spaces
**0%**   - Unstructured and/or incoherent. Illustrations are very poorly presented.
